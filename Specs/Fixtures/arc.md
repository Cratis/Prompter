<TopicHero icon="puzzle" eyebrow="Arc" title="Full-stack CQRS, typed to the browser">
Turn **commands** and **queries** into a full-stack CQRS application with **generated TypeScript proxies** that keep React in lockstep with your C#: no hand-written API client, no DTO duplication. Arc pairs naturally with Chronicle's event sourcing, and runs just as well over MongoDB or EF Core — no event log required.

## Start here

<CardGrid>
  <SimpleCard title="Your first command & query" icon="rocket" link="/arc/backend/getting-started/your-first-command/">
    Build a backend slice end to end: a command with `Handle()`, the read model it writes, and the live query that serves it.
  </SimpleCard>
  <SimpleCard title="Wire up the React frontend" icon="seti:react" link="/arc/frontend/getting-started/">
    Consume the generated proxies from React — a typed query and a command, with the client model generated from C#.
  </SimpleCard>
  <SimpleCard title="MediatR, MVC, and Arc" icon="right-arrow" link="/arc/coming-from-mediatr-and-mvc/">
    Maps controllers, handlers, and DTOs onto Arc's command/query model so the shift is short.

  <SimpleCard title="Integrate with Chronicle" icon="seti:db" link="/arc/backend/chronicle/">
    Add Chronicle when a slice needs events, projections, reducers, reactors, history, or aggregate roots.

  <SimpleCard title="Backend" icon="seti:c-sharp" link="/arc/backend/">
    Commands, queries, validation, identity, tenancy, persistence, and proxy generation.

  <SimpleCard title="Frontend" icon="laptop" link="/arc/frontend/">
    React integration, command forms, observable queries, and the optional MVVM approach.

Arc feeds [Components](/components/) and gives the application its CQRS boundary. In the full Cratis loop it sits on top of [Chronicle](/chronicle/) through the [Chronicle integration](/arc/backend/chronicle/); for bounded current-state slices it can also run over MongoDB or EF Core. See [Why developers choose Cratis](/why-cratis/) for how the pieces fit.
